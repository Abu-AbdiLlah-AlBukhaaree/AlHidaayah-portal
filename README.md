# Al-Hidayah-Portal
Welcome to Al-Hidayah-Portal.

## Why this project?
After learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS, and working on small-scale projects, I decided to build a bigger project. A friend of mine suggested that I build the  front end of a school portal.

## Why is the Portal Incomplete?

I stopped building it because I have spent a lot of time on it, and I still have a lot of things to learn.

I plan to **continue** it after I learn `svelte` and `svelte-kit`

## SUGGESTIONS

If you find any bugs, or you have suggestions on how to improve some parts of the code, please don't hesitate to open an issue. _Thanks!_
