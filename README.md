# Al-Hidayah-Portal

### Why is the Portal Incomplete

I stopped building it because I have spent a lot of time on it, and I still have a lot of things to learn.

I plan to **continue** it after I learn `Next.js`

### FAVICON

If you need the favicon used, I have added it to the /assets/icons folder

### SUGGESTIONS

If you found any bug, or you have suggestions on how to improve some part of the code, please don't hesitate to open an issue. _Thanks!_
